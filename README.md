# Simple PHP Gallery

Simple web gallery written in PHP - the one I use on my personal website (http://gallery.peldax.com).

Feel free to use or contribute.

## How to use

1.) Download the sources and upload them to your server.

2.) Create a directory named "cache" (for cached thumbnails) and "album" (for your images) in the same folder.

3.) Copy your pictures/directories into the "album" folder.

4.) In the index.php, change HTML elements such as head and footer to your needs.
