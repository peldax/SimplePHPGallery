# Simple PHP Gallery

Simple web gallery written in PHP - the one I use on my personal website (http://gallery.peldax.com).

Gallery is designed to be:

* Lightweight
* Fast
* Free

Feel free to use or contribute.

## How to use

1. Download the sources and upload them to your server.
2. Create a directory named "cache" (for cached thumbnails) and "album" (for your images) in the same folder.
3. Copy your pictures/directories into the "album" folder.
4. In the index.php, change HTML elements such as head and footer to your needs.
