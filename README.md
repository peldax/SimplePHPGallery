Simple web gallery written in PHP - the one I use on my personal website (http://gallery.peldax.com).
Gallery doesn't require jQuery or any other framework.

Gallery is designed to be:

* Lightweight
* Fast
* Free

Feel free to use or contribute.

## How to set

1. Download the sources and upload them to your server.
2. Create a directory named "cache" (for cached thumbnails) and "album" (for your images) in the same folder.
3. Copy your pictures/directories into the "album" folder (album/year/month/folder/image).

## How to customize

1. Style your gallery in stylesheet.css.
2. Change HTML elements such as head and footer to your needs in index.php.
3. Customize your error page in error.php.
